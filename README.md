# AndroidFragmentAnimation
Small Android Application demonstrating simple usage of fragments and Animations. Built for entry level android developers. Use at your risk and pleasure. :)


## What's in there

1. 2 fragments: AFragment, BFragment.
2. MainActivity: Responsible for fragments and some simeple Animation/Transitions.
3. 2 Animators that modify the X property: slide_left, slide_right


### Disclaimer 

Made this for a session.
The overly simplified targeted aspects makes it easy to get started on Fragments and Transition/Animations.
